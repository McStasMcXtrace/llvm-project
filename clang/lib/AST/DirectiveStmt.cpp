SourceRange DirectiveStmt::getConstructRange(bool *FinalSemicolonIsNext) const {
  // TODO: We haven't found a clean way to determine the location of the last
  // token from an AST node, so we implemented the following.  The switch below
  // has cases for AST node types that are known to require special handling,
  // and the default case employs a general approach that so far works for
  // other AST node types.  It might need new cases if we discover bugs.  When
  // OpenACC support is upstreamed, this switch statement should probably
  // migrate into a Stmt member function, perhaps named getFullSourceRange,
  // such that the Stmt implementation comes from the default case and other
  // AST node types' overriding implementations come from the other cases.
  //
  // Instead of all this, we previously tried to use getSourceRange (after
  // fixing it for DirectiveStmt), but it doesn't work when a ForStmt's body is
  // an DirectiveStmt because ForStmt's getSourceRange then calls the
  // DirectiveStmt's getEndLoc instead of its getSourceRange.
  //
  // We also tried to implement one general approach that works for all AST
  // node types by descending through the AST looking for the node with the
  // last location.  However, do you use spelling, expansion, or presumed
  // locations (as documented in SourceManager.h)?  Spelling locations don't
  // work because, if the last token is expanded from a macro, its spelling
  // location might be before any other token.  Expansion locations don't work
  // because tokens expanded from the same macro invocation have the same
  // location.  Presumed locations don't work because #line can make tokens
  // appear to be in a different order.  Using operator< for original
  // SourceLocation objects before conversion to any of those forms doesn't
  // work because tokens expanded from macros then appear to occur after other
  // tokens.  Instead, we just use AST node types to determine where to find
  // the last token's location, and we return the original SourceLocation
  // objects there to the caller to convert to any location form the caller
  // desires.

      // associated statement (which is then its child), getEndLoc on the
      // DirectiveStmt points to the end of the directive only, so the child
      // must be examined.

      // node type that has multiple children such that the child with the last
