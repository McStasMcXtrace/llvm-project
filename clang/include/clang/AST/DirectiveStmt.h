/// contains common functionality that does not appear in upstream OpenMP

/// functionality and that already appears in upstream OpenMP, CRTP could be
/// used to expose it here.  For example, we could have a getAssociatedStmt

  /// If FinalSemicolonIsNext != nullptr, *FinalSemicolonIsNext is set to
  /// indicate whether the result does not include a final semicolon
  /// (currently, this happens when the associated statement ends with an
  /// expression statement, which is represented by Expr, which does include
  /// NullStmt). If true and the caller wants to find the final semicolon,
  /// the caller can re-lex the input starting at the result's end location,
  /// which points at the token before the final semicolon.  However, the
  /// caller must be sure to handle cases where either of these tokens
  /// appears in a macro expansion, which can affect re-lexing and the
  /// interpretation of a SourceLocation.  Because we haven't found a
  /// re-lexing technique that can always determine the final semicolon's
  /// location in such cases, and because some callers don't care if the result
  /// includes the final semicolon, we don't try to handle the re-lexing here.
